# Actual Deliverables
As a user I want... 
* to be able to click the button and add a taco emoji to the list
* to be able to click an emoji and change it to a coconut
* to be able to right-click an emoji and delete it
* to be able to click an emoji and cycle through ["🍩", "🌮", "🥥", "🍣"]
          * This one is really hard — feel free to attempt but it's nothing to be discouraged by if you struggle with it!

# Gotchas
* What will happen if I += the innerHTML of an element with children that have event handlers?
