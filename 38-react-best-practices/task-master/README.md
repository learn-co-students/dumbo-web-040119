React Best Practices
====================

## SWBAT

- [ ] Begin using the React Dev Tools
- [ ] Write cleaner React code

## Objectives

**Opinions**
- [ ] Code Organization/file structure
  - Containers vs Components
  - Organized by domain
  - Organized by page
- [ ] Presentational vs Container components
  - Presentational
    - functional components
    - no state
    - sole purpose is to render
  - Container
    - class component
    - has state
    - responsible for container logic and behavior

**The More You Know**

- [ ] Functional vs Class Components
  - [ ] Implicit return for Functional components

- [ ] Fragments

- [ ] Callbacks (avoid useless wrapping)

- Syntax tricks often seen in React:
  - [ ] Arrow functions returning objects
  - [ ] Destructuring
  - [ ] Spread (w/ prepend and append)
  - [ ] Objects with the same key/value name
  - [ ] constructor vs. ES7 instance variables
  - [ ] map (as a way to update objects in an array of objects)
  - [ ] { [variable]: "as_key" }
