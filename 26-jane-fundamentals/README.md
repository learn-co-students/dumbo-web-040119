- Hoisting
- Function syntax
- Declaration/expression
- Being aware that functions can be stored as variables
- Iterators
- ES6 arrow syntax
- Let/const/var
- Block scope versus function scope
- Scope chain in functions/global
- PBV, PBR
    - Slice, object.assign, spread operator
- Falsy data types

Take-Aways: 
- if you plan to use functions before they're defined, use function declarations
- use let/const instead of var 
- pay attention to falsy values (different from Ruby)
- get used to arrow functions 
- copy arrays/objects using the spread operator

Next time: 
- Promises, and .then
- Async/await
